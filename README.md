# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Challenge

Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Assigned User Story:

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

## Technology Used

- Express.js
- MongoDB database
- Mongoose
- JSON
- Node.js
- Insomnia
- Visual Studio Code

## Installation Instructions

To install packages, run npm install in your terminal:

        npm i

Check your package-lock.json file to ensure appropriate applications were installed.

## Getting Started

To initiate the application, run npm run start in your terminal:

        npm run start

The application is successfully running when you receive the message: "API server running on port 3001!"

Open Insomnia and run the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to view all endpoints.

## Walkthrough Video

Walkthrough Video coming soon!

<!-- Linked here is a video that walks through the application. [Video-Walkthrough](#video-walkthrough) -->

## Continued Development

I was unsuccessful in connecting my application with MongoDB, so there is currently no data to verify in Insomnia. This is a learning opportunity that I expect to fix and update at a later time.
